# Music Mixer 

 A 'Music Mixer' website with implemented drag and drop functionality to load audio clips and create a dynamic audio experience, triggering animationations, and play compiled audio track. 

## Installation

To install, simply use the 'Clone' function in Github (Code > Local). You can do this three ways:

1. Close using web url (Local > HTTPS > Copy Symbol)
2. Open in 'GitHub Desktop' which should automatically open the GitHub Application on your desktop with the following option to clone to desktop and add your desired location. (Local > Open in GitHub Desktop > Clone)
3. Download Zip File (Local > Download Zip File)

## Usage

To experiment with beginner Java Scripting, demonstrate skills such as building out an HTML and CSS using correct tags and best practices, designing a interactive, and functional UI for the website using designing best practices, and finally, present a working 'Music Mixer' website that is both functional and interactive. 

The usage for the Music Mixer website itself is to drag and drop different sounds and experiment with combinations of beats through a fun and interactive experience.
